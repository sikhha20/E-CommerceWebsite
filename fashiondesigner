A fashion designer is a creative professional who specializes in designing clothing, accessories, and footwear. They blend aesthetics, functionality, and innovation to create original, stylish, and wearable pieces. Fashion designers often begin by researching trends, fabrics, and color palettes before sketching their designs. They use a combination of hand-drawing and computer software to bring their ideas to life.
